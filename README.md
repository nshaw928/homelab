# homelab

## Purpose
I'm creating a Kubernetes + GitOps homelab to replace my docker compose based homelab running on an Ubuntu mini pc. I've been self hosting for almost 3 years now, and it is about time I upgrade to a more professional managed homelab.

## Structure

### 1 - Bootstrap
- foundational resources that are created first

### 2 - Infrastructure
- cluster-level services that are not user facing

### 3 - Apps
- user facing applications organized by usecase

**App Categories**:
- productivity
